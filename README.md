Demo Code for UCS Manager showing how to add Global VLANs to FIs and assign the VLAN to a group. This code is not intended for production systems and could cause serious issues if run against a system without understanding the code. You should review this code competely before running it against any system. VLANS cannot be passed as an argument in this version, though the code could support this with minor changes. You must edit this code directly to specify the VLANS as designed.
